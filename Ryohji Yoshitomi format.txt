The music format seems to be derived from Hirokazu Tanaka's format, although there are some differences.

Music Pointer Table
=======================================
The music pointer table is comprised of 16-bit pointers to each song. Immediately following it is flags specifying the panning for each song. The pointer table is located at $5F30 in Metroid 2, and $5CA6 in Wario Land.

Song Headers
=======================================
Each song has a header which is specified as follows:
1 byte = Song transpose
2 bytes = Pointer to speed/tempo table
2 bytes = Pointer to channel 1
2 bytes = Pointer to channel 2
2 bytes = Pointer to channel 3
2 bytes = Pointer to channel 4

Channel Headers
=======================================
Each channel of a song has the following values for a header:
2 bytes (repeat): Pointers to sequences
4 bytes: 00F0 and then pointer to loop in pattern: Go to loop
2 bytes: 0000: End of song without loop

Sequence Commands
=======================================
The commands of each sequence in a song are structured as follows:
00 = End of sequence
01 = Rest
03 = Echo (v1)
05 = Echo (v2)
xx (00-9F, except 01/03/05?) = Play note
Ax = Change note length
F1 xx yy zz (CH1/2) = Set channel parameters (X = descending envelope, Y = ascending sweep, Z = length duty)
F1 xxxx yy zz (CH3) = Set channel parameters (X = Wave pointer, Y = ?, Z = ?)
F2 xxxx = Change song speed table
F3 xx = Transpose (global?)
F4 xx = Repeat section # of times
F5 = End of repeat

Note Length Tables
=======================================
These tables specify the length of each note relative to the Ax commands. In Metroid 2, these are 12 bytes long, but in Wario Land, these are 16 bytes long.
